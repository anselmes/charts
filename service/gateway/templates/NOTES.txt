# NOTES.txt

Thank you for installing the Gateway Helm chart!

This chart deploys Gateway API resources, enabling advanced traffic routing and management for your Kubernetes cluster.

## Next Steps

1. **Verify Installation**:
   - Check the status of the Gateway resources to ensure they are created:
     ```bash
     kubectl get gateways -n <namespace>
     ```

2. **Validate Gateway Functionality**:
   - Ensure that the Gateway is properly configured and operational:
     - Check the logs of the Gateway controller for any errors:
       ```bash
       kubectl logs -n <namespace> -l app=gateway-controller
       ```
     - Verify that routes are correctly attached to the Gateway:
       ```bash
       kubectl describe gateway <gateway-name> -n <namespace>
       ```

3. **Monitor Gateway Resources**:
   - Inspect the status of the Gateway and its associated routes:
     ```bash
     kubectl get httproutes,tcproutes,tlsroutes,udproutes -n <namespace>
     ```

4. **Uninstallation**:
   - To uninstall the chart and remove all associated resources, run:
     ```bash
     helm uninstall <release-name> -n <namespace>
     ```

## Additional Information

- For more details on the Gateway API, refer to the [official documentation](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/).
- If you encounter any issues:
  - Check the events in the namespace where the Gateway is deployed:
    ```bash
    kubectl get events -n <namespace>
    ```
  - Review the logs of the Gateway controller for troubleshooting.
