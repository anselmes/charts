routes: []
# Define the routes for the Gateway API.
# Each route specifies the type of traffic (e.g., HTTP, TLS, gRPC) and the backend services to route to.
# Example:
# - name: nginx
#   kind: HTTPRoute
#   hostnames:
#     - nginx.local
#   rules:
#     - backendRefs:
#         - name: nginx-svc
#           port: 80
#   gateways:
#     - name: default-gateway
#       namespace: default
# - name: kafka
#   kind: TLSRoute
#   rules:
#     - backendRefs:
#         - name: kafka-svc
#           port: 9092
#   gateways:
#     - name: tls-gateway
# - name: hello-world
#   kind: GRPCRoute
#   rules:
#     - backendRefs:
#         - name: hello-world-svc
#           port: 8080
#   gateways:
#     - name: grpc-gateway

policies: []
# Define policies for the Gateway API.
# Policies can include validation rules, such as hostname validation or certificate references.
# Example:
# - name: tls-upstream-dev
#   validation:
#     hostname: dev.example.com
#     wellKnownCACertificates: System
#     # caCertificateRefs:
#     #   - group: ""
#     #     kind: ConfigMap
#     #     name: auth-cert

grants: []
# Define resource grants for the Gateway API.
# Grants specify which resources (e.g., Secrets) can be referenced by Gateways.
# Example:
# - name: allow-ns1-gateways-to-ref-secrets
#   to:
#     - group: ""
#       kind: Secret
#   from:
#     - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
#       kind: Gateway

gateways:
# Define the Gateway configurations.
# Each Gateway specifies its name, class, and listeners for handling traffic.
