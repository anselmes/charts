# NOTES

Thank you for installing the ExternalDNS Helm chart!

This chart deploys ExternalDNS and its associated resources, enabling dynamic DNS management for your Kubernetes cluster.

## Next Steps

1. **Verify Installation**:
   - Check the status of the ExternalDNS pods to ensure they are running:
     ```bash
     kubectl get pods -n <namespace> -l app.kubernetes.io/name=external-dns
     ```

2. **Validate ExternalDNS Functionality**:
   - Ensure that ExternalDNS is properly configured and operational:
     - Check the logs of the ExternalDNS pods for any errors:
       ```bash
       kubectl logs -n <namespace> -l app.kubernetes.io/name=external-dns
       ```
     - Verify that DNS records are being created or updated as expected:
       ```bash
       kubectl describe endpoints -n <namespace>
       ```

3. **Monitor DNS Records**:
   - Inspect the DNS records managed by ExternalDNS to ensure they are accurate:
     ```bash
     kubectl get endpoints -n <namespace>
     ```

4. **Uninstallation**:
   - To uninstall the chart and remove all associated resources, run:
     ```bash
     helm uninstall <release-name> -n <namespace>
     ```

## Additional Information

- If you encounter any issues:
  - Check the events in the namespace where ExternalDNS is deployed:
    ```bash
    kubectl get events -n <namespace>
    ```
  - Review the logs of the ExternalDNS pods for troubleshooting.
