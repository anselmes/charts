# NOTES

Thank you for installing the CA Helm chart!

This chart deploys the Certificate Authority (CA) service and its associated resources, enabling secure certificate management for your Kubernetes cluster.

## Next Steps

1. **Verify Installation**:
   - Check the status of the CA pods to ensure they are running:
     ```bash
     kubectl get pods -n <namespace> -l app=ca
     ```

2. **Validate CA Functionality**:
   - Ensure that the CA service is properly configured and operational:
     - Check the logs of the CA pods for any errors:
       ```bash
       kubectl logs -n <namespace> -l app=ca
       ```
     - Verify that certificates are being issued correctly:
       ```bash
       kubectl describe certificates -n <namespace>
       ```

3. **Monitor CA Health**:
   - Inspect the status of the CA resources to ensure all components are healthy:
     ```bash
     kubectl get certificates -n <namespace>
     kubectl get certificaterequests -n <namespace>
     ```

4. **Uninstallation**:
   - To uninstall the chart and remove all associated resources, run:
     ```bash
     helm uninstall <release-name> -n <namespace>
     ```

## Additional Information

- For more details on managing certificates in Kubernetes, refer to the [Kubernetes Certificate Management Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tls/managing-tls-in-a-cluster/).
- If you encounter any issues:
  - Check the events in the namespace where the CA is deployed:
    ```bash
    kubectl get events -n <namespace>
    ```
  - Review the logs of the CA pods for troubleshooting.
